# Rust 101 with examples

This is partly for my understanding as a quick refresher back to some key concepts and for anyone else who might find an example-heavy approach useful. It's written in a literate programming style so one can pick a topic and read from top to bottom.

* [ownership](src/ownership.rs)
* [borrowing](src/borrowing.rs)
* [strings](src/strings.rs)

You can do `cargo run` to run all the code across files. Refer to [main.rs](src/main.rs) for the entry point.
